The PTWP is an accademic non-proffit project based on data with open licencing from The Norwegian Public Roads Administration, The Norwegian Meteorological Institute, and The Norwegian Institute for Air Research. 

Our goal is to make data about air quality accessible and explorable on the internett, mainly making the data easier to comprehend and reflect on for the general populace, but also letting data scientists benefit from the extra power provided by semantic technologies. 

We have lifted data about measurements of air polutants like NO2, data about the amount of cars passing certain points in the city per hour, and weather measurements.

With as few modifications and excemptions to the original data as possible, the data is now stored in RDF graphs accessible for query through the SPARQL endpoint at this site. For visualising our data we have chosen the sgvisler visualisation tool, which is built on google charts but specialises in displaying RDF graphs in a sensible manner.

In addition to developing our own ontology (that we named "http://www.ptwproject.org/ontology#") to describe our data with RDF, we have been using the Semantic Sensor Network ontology, and the OWL time ontology

NB: So far our data consists of a test set, and is restricted to 2016
